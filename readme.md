# A flask API and a Streamlit App for beating the NYT Spelling Bee Game

With this project, I wanted to practice and demonstrate some software engineering skills and tools like version control, unit tests, CI/CD with Github Actions, REST APIs, Docker, and front end interaction with Streamlit. 


I wanted it to be totally unrelated to my day-to-day work, so I attempted to solve the [NYT Spelling Bee puzzle game](https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/spelling-bee).

Try out the live app [here](https://share.streamlit.io/mharty3/spelling_bee/app/streamlit_app.py) on Streamlit Sharing and read about how I made it here: [Part 1](https://mharty3.github.io/blog/spelling-bee/) and [Part 2](https://mharty3.github.io/blog/spelling-bee-part-2/).
